# mvc_pattern
Working on implementing mvc pattern. Project starts off with a beginner way of doing get, at the end get is implemented using the mvc pattern.

# Additional notes
* Mvc is a pattern in which you structure your project
* Divide into 3 parts: modules, views, controllers
* Views is normally frontend
* Created express server
* Routes for different routes: user
* Models: define structure of schema, for database
* Controllers: execute all the different things you want to do with data, manage the data
* Creating a route
